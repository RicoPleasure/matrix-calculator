# MatrixCalculatorElixir

# What is it?

I am learning Elixir and Phoenix so I decided to make this calculator. It is useful because ChatGPT does not make these calculations correctly usually so it's good for both learning Elixir and Algebra.

## Functionalities:

- Determinant
- Transpose
- Multiplication for a constant

# How to run
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
