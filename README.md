# MatrixCalculatorElixir

# Why?

I'm learning Elixir and Phoenix so I decided to make this calculator. It is useful because ChatGPT usually does not make these calculations correctly and it's good for both learning Elixir and Algebra.

## Functionalities:

### Single Matrix Operations
- Determinant
- Transpose
- Multiplication for a constant
- Inverse function

### Matrices Operations
- Multiplication
- Sum
- Subtraction

# How to run
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser...
